Learning Python
===============

`Python <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Programming_Language>`__ is an `open-source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>`_, `interpreted <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language>`_, very `high-level <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_language>`_, `dynamic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language>`_, `object-oriented <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`__ programming language (whew!). A few other languages of this type are `Perl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl>`_, `PHP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php>`_, and `Ruby <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language>`_. Among these languages, Python is particularly good at integrating with lower-level languages such as `C <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language>`_/`C++ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Plus_Plus>`__ and `Java <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming_language>`__ (Python can even `run on top <https://www.jython.org/>`__ of a `Java Virtual Machine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine>`_, if you want).

Taking advantage of this ability to integrate with other languages, the Battlefield 2 game includes a core engine written in `C++ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Plus_Plus>`__ that is inaccessible to developers (other than EA and DICE), and an embedded Python interpreter; non-EA/DICE developers are able to modify many aspects of how BF2 behaves, as well as add new behaviors, by modifying existing Python programs that are part of BF2, or by writing entirely new ones.

Python Language Resources
-------------------------

-  `python.org <https://python.org/>`__

   The main Python website, and includes lots of information and links to other useful sites, including:

   -  `Beginner's Guide to Python <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`__
   -  `Python Tutorial <https://python.org/doc/2.3.4/tut/tut.html>`__

-  `Dive Into Python <https://diveintopython.org/>`__

   Full text of a good intro to Python for people who are already fluent in another programming language.

-  `Google's Python Class <https://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/>`__

Python cookbooks, idioms, and design patterns
---------------------------------------------

-  `ActiveState Python Cookbook <https://code.activestate.com/recipes/>`__
-  `Python Idioms <http://wiki.c2.com/?PythonIdioms>`__
-  `Python Design Patterns <https://python-patterns.guide/>`__

Some good printed books on Python
---------------------------------

-  `Learning Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/>`__
-  `Python in a Nutshell <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-in-a/9781098113544/>`__
-  `Python Cookbook <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook-3rd/9781449357337/>`__
-  `Dive Into Python <https://www.amazon.com/Dive-into-Python-Mark-Pilgrim/dp/1430224150>`__

Downloading Python
------------------

Whether you are new to Python or are an experienced Pythonista trying to debug a program, you'll find that it's handy to have a regular Python interpreter (as opposed to the one embedded in BF2) installed on your PC to experiment with.

The Python embedded in Battlefield 2 is an old version, 2.3.4; if you install a current version to experiment with be aware that there may be some differences between how it behaves and how BF2 Python behaves. Here are best places to download Python.

-  `The official repository for Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
-  `A nicely packaged version that includes lots of commonly-used add-ons <https://www.activestate.com/products/python/>`__

Python IDEs
-----------

There are quite a few good `Integrated Development Environments <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`__ (IDEs) for Python. IDEs are (highly) glorified text editors that offer lots of features that are especially useful to programmers, such as integrated debuggers, class browsers, language documentation, automatic color-coding and line completion, etc. Some of the more noteworthy ones designed for use with Python:

-  `IDLE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html>`__

   Included with the standard Python distribution; pretty basic, but fine if you're just starting out.

-  `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__

   A full-featured open source IDE with Python support.

-  `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__

   Another full-featured open source Python IDE.

-  `Komodo IDE <https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-ide/>`__

   A very good open-source IDE (previously commercial, now retired).
